            <p id="data1" class="hidden">In memoriam of all the house rules that we used to follow because of our cat. Such as, to not leave the windows open at any time, keep delicate objects well of reach from him. Rules I do not remember anymore.</p>
            <p id="data2"  class="hidden">Gone are the days when I held the coveted knowledge of money cheats in the Sims game, those secret codes that bestowed virtual fortune upon my virtual world. Now, as I reflect on those nostalgic memories, the game remains closed, untouched, and the cheats lie buried in the annals of my gaming past, fading like distant echoes of a bygone era.</p>
            <p id="data3"  class="hidden">Rest in peace to the rap songs I once knew by heart, rhymes and beats that used to flow effortlessly from my lips. Now buried deep within the recesses of my mind, their lyrics lost in the passage of time, fading like echoes in the wind, a forgotten cadence I can no longer find.</p>
            <p id="data4"  class="hidden">In loving memory of the intricate campus map that I studied diligently before starting university, navigating the pathways and buildings with precision during my early days as a freshman, now replaced by the GPS on my smartphone.</p>
            <p id="data5"  class="hidden">In  memoriam of the periodic table that I painstakingly memorized for the university exam, forever etched in my mind but rarely used since then.</p>
            <p id="data6"  class="hidden">In remembrance of the outdated and amended statutes that I spent months memorizing for the law exams. What remains are the memory of the sleepless nights before the exams.</p>
            <p id="data7"  class="hidden">Rest in peace to the imaginary games I played with my brother. All the characters invented with only our hands and our imagination will live in my heart.</p>
            <p id="data8"  class="hidden">In remembrance of the many names of potential lovers I met through Tinder. They gave me entertainment, confidence and helped in my own self-development. Some left behind friendships. 
            </p>
            <p id="data9"  class="hidden">Resting beneath this sacred ground are all the facts from the Pokemon tazos, that were etched in my mind. All the children from the neighbourhood were obsessed with collecting and trading these tazos.</p>
            <p id="data10"  class="hidden">In the monument of my mind's embrace,<br>
                Lies a tapestry woven with every experience's trace,<br>
                Every moment, cherished and held in its rightful space,<br>
                A tribute to the mosaic of life's diverse embrace.</p>
            <p id="data11"  class="hidden">In loving memory of the numerous football player names, that I memorized because of my ex-boyfriend, who held the sport very dear to his heart.</p>
            <p id="data12"  class="hidden">To the very dear pin numbers I had to remember everyday to pay with card, that now are not of any use in my contactless-dominated life.</p>
            <p id="data13"  class="hidden">Gone but forever in my memories are the times I collected old unique stamps with details of their facts, because I got passed down an immaculately kept collection from my uncle and I wanted to add to it. The interest was fleeting thoughâ€¦.
            </p>
            <p id="data14"  class="hidden">Sadly, most of the choreographies learnt have passed away. This is a memorial to: the ones from ballroom dance classes after school, the 7-minute choreography from hip-hop class, of course all the kpop dances, and the choreographies learnt for horse riding competitions.</p>
            <p id="data15"  class="hidden">Farewell to all the names of the unique flower species that I collected during the summer of 2005, together with my two best friends for our class assignment. I should have dried them and kept them forever.</p>
            <p id="data16"  class="hidden">Here lies all the recipes I had memorised by making them continuously for my younger brother during our summer holidays, when I had to take care of him as mom and dad both were out for work. He liked the bread pizza I made the most, to the point where we were both sick of eating it.</p>
            <p id="data17"  class="hidden">In remembrance of all the badges and scarves, I had to keep inventory of as the house prefect. But I still remember the repeat offenders who forgot their scarves every Fridays assembly. </p>
            <p id="data18"  class="hidden">Resting beneath this hallowed ground lies all the amusement parks near my city, that I can no longer remember, as they have been replaced or were torn down to make way for new developments.</p>
            <p id="data19"  class="hidden">Farewell to the dozens of novels that entertained me during all those years before social media took over all my free time.</p>
            <p id="data20"  class="hidden">In remembrance of the outdated bare acts and amended statutes that I spent months memorizing for the bar exam. I still remember useless information from them that are not in use anymore.</p>
